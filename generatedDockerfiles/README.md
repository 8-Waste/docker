# generatedDockerfiles

As a convenience, this directory contains a Dockerfile generated by `rapidsdevtool.sh` for each of the templates currently listed as `templates/docker/Dockerfile_*`. See the [README](https://github.com/rapidsai/build/blob/branch-0.7/README.md) for more information on how to update and generate these Dockerfiles.
