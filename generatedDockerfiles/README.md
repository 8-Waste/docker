# generatedDockerfiles

As a convenience, this directory contains a Dockerfile generated by `rapidsdevtool.sh` for each of the templates currently listed as `templates/docker/Dockerfile_*`. See the [README](https://github.com/rapidsai/build/blob/branch-0.7/README.md) for more information on how to update and generate these Dockerfiles.

The build context for these Dockerfiles is generated by the `rapidsdevtool.sh buildDockerImage` command, but a container image can still be created if the following build context is in place:
- a directory named `rapids` with a `clone.sh` and `build.sh` script that can be called with a repo name as an argument to clone or build the repo, respectively.
- a copy of the `supportfiles` directory from the root of this repo
- a copy of the `utils` directory from the root of this repo
